# pizzaProtocolAssests
This repo only purpose is to store the assests of the game that are in development to avoid us having to put work in progress sprites and assests in the Pizza Protocol repositorty. This will mainly have .pngs and .aesprites that are either in the game, were in the game, wips, or planned to be in the game.
